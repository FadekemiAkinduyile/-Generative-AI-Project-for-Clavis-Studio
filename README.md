# Generative-AI-Project-for-Clavis-Studio

# Project Objective
The objective of the project was to leverage Generative AI, specifically the Stable Diffusion model, to facilitate accessible floor plan designs for Clavis Studio clients lacking design skills. The project involved using text-to-image generation techniques to create innovative solutions and enhance the client experience. The backend was built using PyTorch and Hugging Face's datasets library, and the model was fine-tuned with Clavis Studio's dataset.

# Knowledge/ Skill Gained
Working on the backend for Clavis Studio significantly expanded my understanding of machine learning projects in several key aspects as follows:
1.	Data Preprocessing and Loading:
•	Utilizing the Hugging Face datasets library to load and preprocess the image dataset.
•	Cleaning image names and organizing them into a format suitable for training.
2.	Model Architecture and Fine-tuning:
•	Utilizing pre-trained models and fine-tuning for specific tasks by leveraging Hugging Face libraries for datasets and models.
•	Implementing a state-of-the-art model, Stable Diffusion, for a generative design task.
•	Applied pre-trained models and fine-tuning techniques for a real-world design task. 
•	Fine-tuning the pre-trained model with Clavis Studio's dataset to make it specific to the target domain.
3.	Training and Acceleration:
•	Configuring and using the Hugging Face Accelerate library for efficient training.
•	Utilizing mixed precision training and gradient checkpointing for faster and more memory-efficient computations.
4.	Deployment and Inference:
•	Configuring the environment for training and deployment.
•	Implementing an inference pipeline to generate design images from text prompts.
5.	Version Control and Collaboration:
•	Leveraging Hugging Face Hub for model version control and collaboration.
